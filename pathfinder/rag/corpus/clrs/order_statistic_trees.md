**Figure 17.1** An order-statistic tree, which is an augmented red-black tree. In addition to its usual attributes, each node x has an attribute x:*size*, which is the number of nodes, other than the sentinel, in the subtree rooted at x.

Figure 17.1 shows a data structure that can support fast order-statistic operations. An *order-statistic tree* T is simply a red-black tree with additional information stored in each node. Each node x contains the usual red-black tree attributes x:*key*, x:*color*, x:*p*, x:*left*, and x:*right*, along with a new attribute, x:*size*. This attribute contains the number of internal nodes in the subtree rooted at x (including x itself, but not including any sentinels), that is, the size of the subtree. If we define the sentinel's size to be 0—that is, we set T:*nil*:*size* to be 0—then we have the identity

$$x.size = x.left.size + x.right.size + 1$$
.

Keys need not be distinct in an order-statistic tree. For example, the tree in Figure 17.1 has two keys with value 14 and two keys with value 21. When equal keys are present, the above notion of rank is not well defined. We remove this ambiguity for an order-statistic tree by defining the rank of an element as the position at which it would be printed in an inorder walk of the tree. In Figure 17.1, for example, the key 14 stored in a black node has rank 5, and the key 14 stored in a red node has rank 6.

#### **Retrieving the element with a given rank**

Before we show how to maintain the size information during insertion and deletion, let's see how to implement two order-statistic queries that use this additional information. We begin with an operation that retrieves the element with a given rank. The procedure OS-SELECT(x, i) on the following page returns a pointer to the node containing the ith smallest key in the subtree rooted at x. To find the node with the ith smallest key in an order-statistic tree T, call OS-SELECT(T:*root*, i).

Here is how OS-SELECT works. Line 1 computes r, the rank of node x within the subtree rooted at x. The value of x:*left*:*size* is the number of nodes that come

```
OS-SELECT(x, i)
1 r = x:left:size + 1 // rank of x within the subtree rooted at x
2 if i == r
3     return x
4 elseif i < r
5     return OS-SELECT(x:left, i)
6 else return OS-SELECT(x:right, i - r)
```

before x in an inorder tree walk of the subtree rooted at x. Thus, x:*left*:*size* + 1 is the rank of x within the subtree rooted at x. If i = r, then node x is the ith smallest element, and so line 3 returns x. If i < r, then the ith smallest element resides in x's left subtree, and therefore, line 5 recurses on x:*left*. If i > r, then the ith smallest element resides in x's right subtree. Since the subtree rooted at x contains r elements that come before x's right subtree in an inorder tree walk, the ith smallest element in the subtree rooted at x is the (i - r)th smallest element in the subtree rooted at x:*right*. Line 6 determines this element recursively.

As an example of how OS-SELECT operates, consider a search for the 17th smallest element in the order-statistic tree of Figure 17.1. The search starts with x as the root, whose key is 26, and with i = 17. Since the size of 26's left subtree is 12, its rank is 13. Thus, the node with rank 17 is the 17 - 13 = 4th smallest element in 26's right subtree. In the recursive call, x is the node with key 41, and i = 4. Since the size of 41's left subtree is 5, its rank within its subtree is 6. Therefore, the node with rank 4 is the 4th smallest element in 41's left subtree. In the recursive call, x is the node with key 30, and its rank within its subtree is 2. The procedure recurses once again to find the 4 - 2 = 2nd smallest element in the subtree rooted at the node with key 38. Its left subtree has size 1, which means it is the second smallest element. Thus, the procedure returns a pointer to the node with key 38.

Because each recursive call goes down one level in the order-statistic tree, the total time for OS-SELECT is at worst proportional to the height of the tree. Since the tree is a red-black tree, its height is O(lg n), where n is the number of nodes. Thus, the running time of OS-SELECT is O(lg n) for a dynamic set of n elements.

#### **Determining the rank of an element**

Given a pointer to a node x in an order-statistic tree T, the procedure OS-RANK on the facing page returns the position of x in the linear order determined by an inorder tree walk of T.

```
OS-RANK(T, x)
1 r = x:left:size + 1 // rank of x within the subtree rooted at x
2 y = x // root of subtree being examined 
3 while y ≠ T:root 
4     if y == y:p:right // if root of a right subtree . . . 
5         r = r + y:p:left:size + 1 // . . . add in parent and its left subtree 
6     y = y:p // move y toward the root 
7 return r
```

The OS-RANK procedure works as follows. You can think of node x's rank as the number of nodes preceding x in an inorder tree walk, plus 1 for x itself. OS-RANK maintains the following loop invariant:

At the start of each iteration of the **while** loop of lines 3–6, r is the rank of x:*key* in the subtree rooted at node y.

We use this loop invariant to show that OS-RANK works correctly as follows:

**Initialization:** Prior to the first iteration, line 1 sets r to be the rank of x:*key* within the subtree rooted at x. Setting y = x in line 2 makes the invariant true the first time the test in line 3 executes.

**Maintenance:** At the end of each iteration of the **while** loop, line 6 sets y = y:*p*. Thus, we must show that if r is the rank of x:*key* in the subtree rooted at y at the start of the loop body, then r is the rank of x:*key* in the subtree rooted at y:*p* at the end of the loop body. In each iteration of the **while** loop, consider the subtree rooted at y:*p*. The value of r already includes the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at node y that precede x in an inorder walk, and so the procedure must add the nodes in the subtree rooted at y's sibling that precede x in an inorder walk, plus 1 for y:*p* if it, too, precedes x. If y is a left child, then neither y:*p* nor any node in y:*p*'s right subtree precedes x, and so OS-RANK leaves r alone. Otherwise, y is a right child and all the nodes in y:*p*'s left subtree precede x, as does y:*p* itself. In this case, line 5 adds y:*p*:*left*:*size* + 1 to the current value of r.

**Termination:** Because each iteration of the loop moves y toward the root and the loop terminates when y = T:*root*, the loop eventually terminates. Moreover, the subtree rooted at y is the entire tree. Thus, the value of r is the rank of x:*key* in the entire tree.

As an example, when OS-RANK runs on the order-statistic tree of Figure 17.1 to find the rank of the node with key 38, the following sequence of values of y:*key* and r occurs at the top of the **while** loop:

| iteration | y:key | r  |
|-----------|-------|----|
| 1         | 38    | 2  |
| 2         | 30    | 4  |
| 3         | 41    | 4  |
| 4         | 26    | 17 |

The procedure returns the rank 17.

Since each iteration of the **while** loop takes O(1) time, and y goes up one level in the tree with each iteration, the running time of OS-RANK is at worst proportional to the height of the tree: O(lg n) on an n-node order-statistic tree.

# **Maintaining subtree sizes**

Given the *size* attribute in each node, OS-SELECT and OS-RANK can quickly compute order-statistic information. But if the basic modifying operations on redblack trees cannot efficiently maintain the *size* attribute, our work will have been for naught. Let's see how to maintain subtree sizes for both insertion and deletion without affecting the asymptotic running time of either operation.

Recall from Section 13.3 that insertion into a red-black tree consists of two phases. The first phase goes down the tree from the root, inserting the new node as a child of an existing node. The second phase goes up the tree, changing colors and performing rotations to maintain the red-black properties.

To maintain the subtree sizes in the first phase, simply increment x:*size* for each node x on the simple path traversed from the root down toward the leaves. The new node added gets a *size* of 1. Since there are O(lg n) nodes on the traversed path, the additional cost of maintaining the *size* attributes is O(lg n).

In the second phase, the only structural changes to the underlying red-black tree are caused by rotations, of which there are at most two. Moreover, a rotation is a local operation: only two nodes have their *size* attributes invalidated. The link around which the rotation is performed is incident on these two nodes. Referring to the code for LEFT-ROTATE(T, x) on page 336, add the following lines:

```
13 y:size = x:size
14 x:size = x:left:size + x:right:size + 1
```

Figure 17.2 illustrates how the attributes are updated. The change to RIGHT-ROTATE is symmetric.

Since inserting into a red-black tree requires at most two rotations, updating the *size* attributes in the second phase costs only O(1) additional time. Thus, the total time for insertion into an n-node order-statistic tree is O(lg n), which is asymptotically the same as for an ordinary red-black tree.

**Figure 17.2** Updating subtree sizes during rotations. The updates are local, requiring only the *size* information stored in x, y, and the roots of the subtrees shown as triangles.

Deletion from a red-black tree also consists of two phases: the first operates on the underlying search tree, and the second causes at most three rotations and otherwise performs no structural changes. (See Section 13.4.) The first phase removes one node z from the tree and could move at most two other nodes within the tree (nodes y and x in Figure 12.4 on page 323). To update the subtree sizes, simply traverse a simple path from the lowest node that moves (starting from its original position within the tree) up to the root, decrementing the *size* attribute of each node on the path. Since this path has length O(lg n) in an n-node redblack tree, the additional time spent maintaining *size* attributes in the first phase is O(lg n). For the O(1) rotations in the second phase of deletion, handle them in the same manner as for insertion. Thus, both insertion and deletion, including maintaining the *size* attributes, take O(lg n) time for an n-node order-statistic tree.

# **17.2 How to augment a data structure**

The process of augmenting a basic data structure to support additional functionality occurs quite frequently in algorithm design. We'll use it again in the next section to design a data structure that supports operations on intervals. This section examines the steps involved in such augmentation. It includes a useful theorem that allows you to augment red-black trees easily in many cases.

You can break the process of augmenting a data structure into four steps:

- 1. Choose an underlying data structure.
- 2. Determine additional information to maintain in the underlying data structure.
- 3. Verify that you can maintain the additional information for the basic modifying operations on the underlying data structure.
- 4. Develop new operations.

As with any prescriptive design method, you'll rarely be able to follow the steps precisely in the order given. Most design work contains an element of trial and error, and progress on all steps usually proceeds in parallel. There is no point,
