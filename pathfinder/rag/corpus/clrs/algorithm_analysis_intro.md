you can identify the most efficient one. There might be more than just one viable candidate, but you can often rule out several inferior algorithms in the process.

Before you can analyze an algorithm, you need a model of the technology that it runs on, including the resources of that technology and a way to express their costs. Most of this book assumes a generic one-processor, *random-access machine (RAM)* model of computation as the implementation technology, with the understanding that algorithms are implemented as computer programs. In the RAM model, instructions execute one after another, with no concurrent operations. The RAM model assumes that each instruction takes the same amount of time as any other instruction and that each data access—using the value of a variable or storing into a variable—takes the same amount of time as any other data access. In other words, in the RAM model each instruction or data access takes a constant amount of time—even indexing into an array.<sup>9</sup>

Strictly speaking, we should precisely define the instructions of the RAM model and their costs. To do so, however, would be tedious and yield little insight into algorithm design and analysis. Yet we must be careful not to abuse the RAM model. For example, what if a RAM had an instruction that sorts? Then you could sort in just one step. Such a RAM would be unrealistic, since such instructions do not appear in real computers. Our guide, therefore, is how real computers are designed. The RAM model contains instructions commonly found in real computers: arithmetic (such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder, floor, ceiling), data movement (load, store, copy), and control (conditional and unconditional branch, subroutine call and return).

The data types in the RAM model are integer, floating point (for storing realnumber approximations), and character. Real computers do not usually have a separate data type for the boolean values TRUE and FALSE. Instead, they often test whether an integer value is 0 (FALSE) or nonzero (TRUE), as in C. Although we typically do not concern ourselves with precision for floating-point values in this book (many numbers cannot be represented exactly in floating point), precision is crucial for most applications. We also assume that each word of data has a limit on the number of bits. For example, when working with inputs of size n, we typically

<sup>9</sup> We assume that each element of a given array occupies the same number of bytes and that the elements of a given array are stored in contiguous memory locations. For example, if array A[1 : n] starts at memory address 1000 and each element occupies four bytes, then element A[i] is at address 1000 + 4(i - 1). In general, computing the address in memory of a particular array element requires at most one subtraction (no subtraction for a 0-origin array), one multiplication (often implemented as a shift operation if the element size is an exact power of 2), and one addition. Furthermore, for code that iterates through the elements of an array in order, an optimizing compiler can generate the address of each element using just one addition, by adding the element size to the address of the preceding element.

assume that integers are represented by c log <sup>2</sup> n bits for some constant c ≥ 1. We require c ≥ 1 so that each word can hold the value of n, enabling us to index the individual input elements, and we restrict c to be a constant so that the word size does not grow arbitrarily. (If the word size could grow arbitrarily, we could store huge amounts of data in one word and operate on it all in constant time—an unrealistic scenario.)

Real computers contain instructions not listed above, and such instructions represent a gray area in the RAM model. For example, is exponentiation a constanttime instruction? In the general case, no: to compute x <sup>n</sup> when x and n are general integers typically takes time logarithmic in n (see equation (31.34) on page 934), and you must worry about whether the result fits into a computer word. If n is an exact power of 2, however, exponentiation can usually be viewed as a constant-time operation. Many computers have a "shift left" instruction, which in constant time shifts the bits of an integer by n positions to the left. In most computers, shifting the bits of an integer by 1 position to the left is equivalent to multiplying by 2, so that shifting the bits by n positions to the left is equivalent to multiplying by 2 n . Therefore, such computers can compute 2 n in 1 constant-time instruction by shifting the integer 1 by n positions to the left, as long as n is no more than the number of bits in a computer word. We'll try to avoid such gray areas in the RAM model and treat computing 2 n and multiplying by 2 n as constant-time operations when the result is small enough to fit in a computer word.

The RAM model does not account for the memory hierarchy that is common in contemporary computers. It models neither caches nor virtual memory. Several other computational models attempt to account for memory-hierarchy effects, which are sometimes significant in real programs on real machines. Section 11.5 and a handful of problems in this book examine memory-hierarchy effects, but for the most part, the analyses in this book do not consider them. Models that include the memory hierarchy are quite a bit more complex than the RAM model, and so they can be difficult to work with. Moreover, RAM-model analyses are usually excellent predictors of performance on actual machines.

Although it is often straightforward to analyze an algorithm in the RAM model, sometimes it can be quite a challenge. You might need to employ mathematical tools such as combinatorics, probability theory, algebraic dexterity, and the ability to identify the most significant terms in a formula. Because an algorithm might behave differently for each possible input, we need a means for summarizing that behavior in simple, easily understood formulas.

#### **Analysis of insertion sort**

How long does the INSERTION-SORT procedure take? One way to tell would be for you to run it on your computer and time how long it takes to run. Of course, you'd 

first have to implement it in a real programming language, since you cannot run our pseudocode directly. What would such a timing test tell you? You would find out how long insertion sort takes to run on your particular computer, on that particular input, under the particular implementation that you created, with the particular compiler or interpreter that you ran, with the particular libraries that you linked in, and with the particular background tasks that were running on your computer concurrently with your timing test (such as checking for incoming information over a network). If you run insertion sort again on your computer with the same input, you might even get a different timing result. From running just one implementation of insertion sort on just one computer and on just one input, what would you be able to determine about insertion sort's running time if you were to give it a different input, if you were to run it on a different computer, or if you were to implement it in a different programming language? Not much. We need a way to predict, given a new input, how long insertion sort will take.

Instead of timing a run, or even several runs, of insertion sort, we can determine how long it takes by analyzing the algorithm itself. We'll examine how many times it executes each line of pseudocode and how long each line of pseudocode takes to run. We'll first come up with a precise but complicated formula for the running time. Then, we'll distill the important part of the formula using a convenient notation that can help us compare the running times of different algorithms for the same problem.

How do we analyze insertion sort? First, let's acknowledge that the running time depends on the input. You shouldn't be terribly surprised that sorting a thousand numbers takes longer than sorting three numbers. Moreover, insertion sort can take different amounts of time to sort two input arrays of the same size, depending on how nearly sorted they already are. Even though the running time can depend on many features of the input, we'll focus on the one that has been shown to have the greatest effect, namely the size of the input, and describe the running time of a program as a function of the size of its input. To do so, we need to define the terms "running time" and "input size" more carefully. We also need to be clear about whether we are discussing the running time for an input that elicits the worst-case behavior, the best-case behavior, or some other case.

The best notion for *input size* depends on the problem being studied. For many problems, such as sorting or computing discrete Fourier transforms, the most natural measure is the *number of items in the input*—for example, the number n of items being sorted. For many other problems, such as multiplying two integers, the best measure of input size is the *total number of bits* needed to represent the input in ordinary binary notation. Sometimes it is more appropriate to describe the size of the input with more than just one number. For example, if the input to an algorithm is a graph, we usually characterize the input size by both the number 

of vertices and the number of edges in the graph. We'll indicate which input size measure is being used with each problem we study.

The *running time* of an algorithm on a particular input is the number of instructions and data accesses executed. How we account for these costs should be independent of any particular computer, but within the framework of the RAM model. For the moment, let us adopt the following view. A constant amount of time is required to execute each line of our pseudocode. One line might take more or less time than another line, but we'll assume that each execution of the kth line takes c<sup>k</sup> time, where c<sup>k</sup> is a constant. This viewpoint is in keeping with the RAM model, and it also reflects how the pseudocode would be implemented on most actual computers. <sup>10</sup>

Let's analyze the INSERTION-SORT procedure. As promised, we'll start by devising a precise formula that uses the input size and all the statement costs ck. This formula turns out to be messy, however. We'll then switch to a simpler notation that is more concise and easier to use. This simpler notation makes clear how to compare the running times of algorithms, especially as the size of the input increases.

To analyze the INSERTION-SORT procedure, let's view it on the following page with the time cost of each statement and the number of times each statement is executed. For each i = 2; 3; : : : ; n, let t<sup>i</sup> denote the number of times the **while** loop test in line 5 is executed for that value of i. When a **for** or **while** loop exits in the usual way—because the test in the loop header comes up FALSE—the test is executed one time more than the loop body. Because comments are not executable statements, assume that they take no time.

The running time of the algorithm is the sum of running times for each statement executed. A statement that takes c<sup>k</sup> steps to execute and executes m times contributes ckm to the total running time. <sup>11</sup> We usually denote the running time of an algorithm on an input of size n by T(n). To compute T(n), the running time of INSERTION-SORT on an input of n values, we sum the products of the *cost* and *times* columns, obtaining

<sup>10</sup> There are some subtleties here. Computational steps that we specify in English are often variants of a procedure that requires more than just a constant amount of time. For example, in the RADIX-SORT procedure on page 213, one line reads "use a stable sort to sort array A on digit i," which, as we shall see, takes more than a constant amount of time. Also, although a statement that calls a subroutine takes only constant time, the subroutine itself, once invoked, may take more. That is, we separate the process of *calling* the subroutine—passing parameters to it, etc.—from the process of *executing* the subroutine.

<sup>11</sup> This characteristic does not necessarily hold for a resource such as memory. A statement that references m words of memory and is executed n times does not necessarily reference mn distinct words of memory.

INSERTION-SORT 
$$(A, n)$$
  $cost times$ 

1 **for**  $i = 2$  **to**  $n$   $c_1$   $n$ 

2  $key = A[i]$   $c_2$   $n-1$ 

3 **// Insert**  $A[i]$  into the sorted subarray  $A[1:i-1]$ .  $0$   $n-1$ 

4  $j = i-1$   $c_4$   $n-1$ 

5 **while**  $j > 0$  and  $A[j] > key$   $c_5$   $\sum_{i=2}^{n} t_i$ 

6  $A[j+1] = A[j]$   $c_6$   $\sum_{i=2}^{n} (t_i-1)$ 

7  $j = j-1$   $c_7$   $\sum_{i=2}^{n} (t_i-1)$ 

8  $A[j+1] = key$   $c_8$   $n-1$ 

$$T(n) = c_1 n + c_2 (n-1) + c_4 (n-1) + c_5 \sum_{i=2}^{n} t_i + c_6 \sum_{i=2}^{n} (t_i - 1) + c_7 \sum_{i=2}^{n} (t_i - 1) + c_8 (n-1).$$

Even for inputs of a given size, an algorithm's running time may depend on *which* input of that size is given. For example, in INSERTION-SORT, the best case occurs when the array is already sorted. In this case, each time that line 5 executes, the value of *key*—the value originally in A[i]—is already greater than or equal to all values in A[1 : i - 1], so that the **while** loop of lines 5–7 always exits upon the first test in line 5. Therefore, we have that t<sup>i</sup> = 1 for i = 2; 3; : : : ; n, and the best-case running time is given by

$$T(n) = c_1 n + c_2 (n-1) + c_4 (n-1) + c_5 (n-1) + c_8 (n-1)$$
  
=  $(c_1 + c_2 + c_4 + c_5 + c_8) n - (c_2 + c_4 + c_5 + c_8)$ . (2.1)

We can express this running time as an + b for *constants* a and b that depend on the statement costs c<sup>k</sup> (where a = c1+c2+c4+c5+c<sup>8</sup> and b = -c2-c4-c5-c8). The running time is thus a *linear function* of n.

The worst case arises when the array is in reverse sorted order—that is, it starts out in decreasing order. The procedure must compare each element A[i] with each element in the entire sorted subarray A[1 : i - 1], and so t<sup>i</sup> = i for i = 2; 3; : : : ; n. (The procedure finds that A[j] > *key* every time in line 5, and the **while** loop exits only when j reaches 0.) Noting that

$$\sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i\right) - 1$$

$$= \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \quad \text{(by equation (A.2) on page 1141)}$$

and

$$\sum_{i=2}^{n} (i-1) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i$$
=  $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$  (again, by equation (A.2)),

we find that in the worst case, the running time of INSERTION-SORT is

$$T(n) = c_1 n + c_2 (n-1) + c_4 (n-1) + c_5 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\right)$$

$$+ c_6 \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right) + c_7 \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right) + c_8 (n-1)$$

$$= \left(\frac{c_5}{2} + \frac{c_6}{2} + \frac{c_7}{2}\right) n^2 + \left(c_1 + c_2 + c_4 + \frac{c_5}{2} - \frac{c_6}{2} - \frac{c_7}{2} + c_8\right) n$$

$$- (c_2 + c_4 + c_5 + c_8) .$$

$$(2.2)$$

We can express this worst-case running time as an<sup>2</sup> + bn + c for constants a, b, and c that again depend on the statement costs c<sup>k</sup> (now, a = c5/2 + c6/2 + c7/2, b = c<sup>1</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>4</sup> + c5/2 - c6/2 - c7/2 + c8, and c = -(c<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>4</sup> + c<sup>5</sup> + c8)). The running time is thus a *quadratic function* of n.

Typically, as in insertion sort, the running time of an algorithm is fixed for a given input, although we'll also see some interesting "randomized" algorithms whose behavior can vary even for a fixed input.

#### **Worst-case and average-case analysis**

Our analysis of insertion sort looked at both the best case, in which the input array was already sorted, and the worst case, in which the input array was reverse sorted. For the remainder of this book, though, we'll usually (but not always) concentrate on finding only the *worst-case running time*, that is, the longest running time for *any* input of size n. Why? Here are three reasons:

- The worst-case running time of an algorithm gives an upper bound on the running time for *any* input. If you know it, then you have a guarantee that the algorithm never takes any longer. You need not make some educated guess about the running time and hope that it never gets much worse. This feature is especially important for real-time computing, in which operations must complete by a deadline.
- For some algorithms, the worst case occurs fairly often. For example, in searching a database for a particular piece of information, the searching algorithm's worst case often occurs when the information is not present in the database. In some applications, searches for absent information may be frequent.

 The "average case" is often roughly as bad as the worst case. Suppose that you run insertion sort on an array of n randomly chosen numbers. How long does it take to determine where in subarray A[1 : i - 1] to insert element A[i]? On average, half the elements in A[1 : i - 1] are less than A[i], and half the elements are greater. On average, therefore, A[i] is compared with just half of the subarray A[1 : i - 1], and so t<sup>i</sup> is about i/2. The resulting average-case running time turns out to be a quadratic function of the input size, just like the worst-case running time.

In some particular cases, we'll be interested in the *average-case* running time of an algorithm. We'll see the technique of *probabilistic analysis* applied to various algorithms throughout this book. The scope of average-case analysis is limited, because it may not be apparent what constitutes an "average" input for a particular problem. Often, we'll assume that all inputs of a given size are equally likely. In practice, this assumption may be violated, but we can sometimes use a *randomized algorithm*, which makes random choices, to allow a probabilistic analysis and yield an *expected* running time. We explore randomized algorithms more in Chapter 5 and in several other subsequent chapters.

## **Order of growth**

In order to ease our analysis of the INSERTION-SORT procedure, we used some simplifying abstractions. First, we ignored the actual cost of each statement, using the constants c<sup>k</sup> to represent these costs. Still, the best-case and worst-case running times in equations (2.1) and (2.2) are rather unwieldy. The constants in these expressions give us more detail than we really need. That's why we also expressed the best-case running time as an+b for constants a and b that depend on the statement costs c<sup>k</sup> and why we expressed the worst-case running time as an<sup>2</sup> + bn + c for constants a, b, and c that depend on the statement costs. We thus ignored not only the actual statement costs, but also the abstract costs ck.

Let's now make one more simplifying abstraction: it is the *rate of growth*, or *order of growth*, of the running time that really interests us. We therefore consider only the leading term of a formula (e.g., an<sup>2</sup> ), since the lower-order terms are relatively insignificant for large values of n. We also ignore the leading term's constant coefficient, since constant factors are less significant than the rate of growth in determining computational efficiency for large inputs. For insertion sort's worst-case running time, when we ignore the lower-order terms and the leading term's constant coefficient, only the factor of n 2 from the leading term remains. That factor, n 2 , is by far the most important part of the running time. For example, suppose that an algorithm implemented on a particular machine takes n <sup>2</sup>/100 + 100n + 17 microseconds on an input of size n. Although the coefficients of 1/100 for the n 2 term and 100 for the n term differ by four orders of magnitude, the n <sup>2</sup>/100 term domi

nates the 100n term once n exceeds 10,000. Although 10,000 might seem large, it is smaller than the population of an average town. Many real-world problems have much larger input sizes.

To highlight the order of growth of the running time, we have a special notation that uses the Greek letter Θ (theta). We write that insertion sort has a worst-case running time of Θ(n<sup>2</sup> ) (pronounced "theta of n-squared" or just "theta n-squared"). We also write that insertion sort has a best-case running time of Θ(n) ("theta of n" or "theta n"). For now, think of Θ-notation as saying "roughly proportional when n is large," so that Θ(n<sup>2</sup> ) means "roughly proportional to n <sup>2</sup> when n is large" and Θ(n) means "roughly proportional to n when n is large" We'll use Θ-notation informally in this chapter and define it precisely in Chapter 3.

We usually consider one algorithm to be more efficient than another if its worstcase running time has a lower order of growth. Due to constant factors and lowerorder terms, an algorithm whose running time has a higher order of growth might take less time for small inputs than an algorithm whose running time has a lower order of growth. But on large enough inputs, an algorithm whose worst-case running time is Θ(n<sup>2</sup> ), for example, takes less time in the worst case than an algorithm whose worst-case running time is Θ(n<sup>3</sup> ). Regardless of the constants hidden by the Θ-notation, there is always some number, say n0, such that for all input sizes n ≥ n0, the Θ(n<sup>2</sup> ) algorithm beats the Θ(n<sup>3</sup> ) algorithm in the worst case.

## **Exercises**

## *2.2-1*

Express the function n <sup>3</sup>/1000 + 100n<sup>2</sup> - 100n + 3 in terms of Θ-notation.

## *2.2-2*

Consider sorting n numbers stored in array A[1 : n] by first finding the smallest element of A[1 : n] and exchanging it with the element in A[1]. Then find the smallest element of A[2 : n], and exchange it with A[2]. Then find the smallest element of A[3 : n], and exchange it with A[3]. Continue in this manner for the first n - 1 elements of A. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as *selection sort*. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run for only the first n-1 elements, rather than for all n elements? Give the worst-case running time of selection sort in Θ-notation. Is the best-case running time any better?

### *2.2-3*

Consider linear search again (see Exercise 2.1-4). How many elements of the input array need to be checked on the average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? How about in the worst case?

Using Θ-notation, give the average-case and worst-case running times of linear search. Justify your answers.

## *2.2-4*

How can you modify any sorting algorithm to have a good best-case running time?

# **2.3 Designing algorithms**

You can choose from a wide range of algorithm design techniques. Insertion sort uses the *incremental* method: for each element A[i], insert it into its proper place in the subarray A[1 : i], having already sorted the subarray A[1 : i - 1].

This section examines another design method, known as "divide-and-conquer," which we explore in more detail in Chapter 4. We'll use divide-and-conquer to design a sorting algorithm whose worst-case running time is much less than that of insertion sort. One advantage of using an algorithm that follows the divide-andconquer method is that analyzing its running time is often straightforward, using techniques that we'll explore in Chapter 4.

## **2.3.1 The divide-and-conquer method**

Many useful algorithms are *recursive* in structure: to solve a given problem, they *recurse* (call themselves) one or more times to handle closely related subproblems. These algorithms typically follow the *divide-and-conquer* method: they break the problem into several subproblems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine these solutions to create a solution to the original problem.

In the divide-and-conquer method, if the problem is small enough—the *base case*—you just solve it directly without recursing. Otherwise—the *recursive case* —you perform three characteristic steps:

**Divide** the problem into one or more subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.

**Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively.

**Combine** the subproblem solutions to form a solution to the original problem.

The *merge sort* algorithm closely follows the divide-and-conquer method. In each step, it sorts a subarray A[p : r], starting with the entire array A[1 : n] and recursing down to smaller and smaller subarrays. Here is how merge sort operates:
