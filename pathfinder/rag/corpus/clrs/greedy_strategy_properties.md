optimal solution to the subproblem with the greedy choice you have made, you arrive at an optimal solution to the original problem.

Later sections of this chapter will use this more direct process. Nevertheless, beneath every greedy algorithm, there is almost always a more cumbersome dynamicprogramming solution.

How can you tell whether a greedy algorithm will solve a particular optimization problem? No way works all the time, but the greedy-choice property and optimal substructure are the two key ingredients. If you can demonstrate that the problem has these properties, then you are well on the way to developing a greedy algorithm for it.

### **Greedy-choice property**

The first key ingredient is the *greedy-choice property*: you can assemble a globally optimal solution by making locally optimal (greedy) choices. In other words, when you are considering which choice to make, you make the choice that looks best in the current problem, without considering results from subproblems.

Here is where greedy algorithms differ from dynamic programming. In dynamic programming, you make a choice at each step, but the choice usually depends on the solutions to subproblems. Consequently, you typically solve dynamicprogramming problems in a bottom-up manner, progressing from smaller subproblems to larger subproblems. (Alternatively, you can solve them top down, but memoizing. Of course, even though the code works top down, you still must solve the subproblems before making a choice.) In a greedy algorithm, you make whatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the subproblem that remains. The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices so far, but it cannot depend on any future choices or on the solutions to subproblems. Thus, unlike dynamic programming, which solves the subproblems before making the first choice, a greedy algorithm makes its first choice before solving any subproblems. A dynamic-programming algorithm proceeds bottom up, whereas a greedy strategy usually progresses top down, making one greedy choice after another, reducing each given problem instance to a smaller one.

Of course, you need to prove that a greedy choice at each step yields a globally optimal solution. Typically, as in the case of Theorem 15.1, the proof examines a globally optimal solution to some subproblem. It then shows how to modify the solution to substitute the greedy choice for some other choice, resulting in one similar, but smaller, subproblem.

You can usually make the greedy choice more efficiently than when you have to consider a wider set of choices. For example, in the activity-selection problem, assuming that the activities were already sorted in monotonically increasing order by finish times, each activity needed to be examined just once. By preprocessing 

the input or by using an appropriate data structure (often a priority queue), you often can make greedy choices quickly, thus yielding an efficient algorithm.

#### **Optimal substructure**

As we saw in Chapter 14, a problem exhibits *optimal substructure* if an optimal solution to the problem contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems. This property is a key ingredient of assessing whether dynamic programming applies, and it's also essential for greedy algorithms. As an example of optimal substructure, recall how Section 15.1 demonstrated that if an optimal solution to subproblem S_ij includes an activity a_k, then it must also contain optimal solutions to the subproblems S_ik and S_kj. Given this optimal substructure, we argued that if you know which activity to use as a_k, you can construct an optimal solution to S_ij by selecting a_k along with all activities in optimal solutions to the subproblems S_ik and S_kj. This observation of optimal substructure gave rise to the recurrence (15.2) that describes the value of an optimal solution.

You will usually use a more direct approach regarding optimal substructure when applying it to greedy algorithms. As mentioned above, you have the luxury of assuming that you arrived at a subproblem by having made the greedy choice in the original problem. All you really need to do is argue that an optimal solution to the subproblem, combined with the greedy choice already made, yields an optimal solution to the original problem. This scheme implicitly uses induction on the subproblems to prove that making the greedy choice at every step produces an optimal solution.

#### **Greedy versus dynamic programming**

Because both the greedy and dynamic-programming strategies exploit optimal substructure, you might be tempted to generate a dynamic-programming solution to a problem when a greedy solution suffices or, conversely, you might mistakenly think that a greedy solution works when in fact a dynamic-programming solution is required. To illustrate the subtle differences between the two techniques, let's investigate two variants of a classical optimization problem.

The *0-1 knapsack problem* is the following. A thief robbing a store wants to take the most valuable load that can be carried in a knapsack capable of carrying at most W pounds of loot. The thief can choose to take any subset of n items in the store. The ith item is worth v_i dollars and weighs w_i pounds, where v_i and w_i are integers. Which items should the thief take? (We call this the 0-1 knapsack problem because for each item, the thief must either take it or leave it behind. The thief cannot take a fractional amount of an item or take an item more than once.)

In the *fractional knapsack problem*, the setup is the same, but the thief can take fractions of items, rather than having to make a binary (0-1) choice for each item. You can think of an item in the 0-1 knapsack problem as being like a gold ingot and an item in the fractional knapsack problem as more like gold dust.

Both knapsack problems exhibit the optimal-substructure property. For the 0-1 problem, if the most valuable load weighing at most W pounds includes item j, then the remaining load must be the most valuable load weighing at most W − w_j pounds that the thief can take from the n − 1 original items excluding item j. For the comparable fractional problem, if the most valuable load weighing at most W pounds includes weight w of item j, then the remaining load must be the most valuable load weighing at most W − w pounds that the thief can take from the n−1 original items plus w_j − w pounds of item j.

Although the problems are similar, a greedy strategy works to solve the fractional knapsack problem, but not the 0-1 problem. To solve the fractional problem, first compute the value per pound v_i/w_i for each item. Obeying a greedy strategy, the thief begins by taking as much as possible of the item with the greatest value per pound. If the supply of that item is exhausted and the thief can still carry more, then the thief takes as much as possible of the item with the next greatest value per pound, and so forth, until reaching the weight limit W. Thus, by sorting the items by value per pound, the greedy algorithm runs in O(n lg n) time. You are asked to prove that the fractional knapsack problem has the greedy-choice property in Exercise 15.2-1.

To see that this greedy strategy does not work for the 0-1 knapsack problem, consider the problem instance illustrated in Figure 15.3(a). This example has three items and a knapsack that can hold 50 pounds. Item 1 weighs 10 pounds and is worth \$60. Item 2 weighs 20 pounds and is worth \$100. Item 3 weighs 30 pounds and is worth \$120. Thus, the value per pound of item 1 is \$6 per pound, which is greater than the value per pound of either item 2 (\$5 per pound) or item 3 (\$4 per pound). The greedy strategy, therefore, would take item 1 first. As you can see from the case analysis in Figure 15.3(b), however, the optimal solution takes items 2 and 3, leaving item 1 behind. The two possible solutions that take item 1 are both suboptimal.

For the comparable fractional problem, however, the greedy strategy, which takes item 1 first, does yield an optimal solution, as shown in Figure 15.3(c). Taking item 1 doesn't work in the 0-1 problem, because the thief is unable to fill the knapsack to capacity, and the empty space lowers the effective value per pound of the load. In the 0-1 problem, when you consider whether to include an item in the knapsack, you must compare the solution to the subproblem that includes the item with the solution to the subproblem that excludes the item before you can make the choice. The problem formulated in this way gives rise to many overlapping sub-

**Figure 15.3** An example showing that the greedy strategy does not work for the 0-1 knapsack problem. **(a)** The thief must select a subset of the three items shown whose weight must not exceed 50 pounds. **(b)** The optimal subset includes items 2 and 3. Any solution with item 1 is suboptimal, even though item 1 has the greatest value per pound. **(c)** For the fractional knapsack problem, taking the items in order of greatest value per pound yields an optimal solution.

problems—a hallmark of dynamic programming, and indeed, as Exercise 15.2-2 asks you to show, you can use dynamic programming to solve the 0-1 problem.

#### *15.2-4*

Professor Gekko has always dreamed of inline skating across North Dakota. The professor plans to cross the state on highway U.S. 2, which runs from Grand Forks, on the eastern border with Minnesota, to Williston, near the western border with Montana. The professor can carry two liters of water and can skate m miles before 

running out of water. (Because North Dakota is relatively flat, the professor does not have to worry about drinking water at a greater rate on uphill sections than on flat or downhill sections.) The professor will start in Grand Forks with two full liters of water. The professor has an official North Dakota state map, which shows all the places along U.S. 2 to refill water and the distances between these locations.

The professor's goal is to minimize the number of water stops along the route across the state. Give an efficient method by which the professor can determine which water stops to make. Prove that your strategy yields an optimal solution, and give its running time.

Prove that your algorithm maximizes the payoff, and state its running time, omitting the time for reordering the sets.

# **15.3 Huffman codes**

Huffman codes compress data well: savings of 20% to 90% are typical, depending on the characteristics of the data being compressed. The data arrive as a sequence of characters. Huffman's greedy algorithm uses a table giving how often each character occurs (its frequency) to build up an optimal way of representing each character as a binary string.

Suppose that you have a 100,000-character data file that you wish to store compactly and you know that the 6 distinct characters in the file occur with the frequencies given by Figure 15.4. The character a occurs 45,000 times, the character b occurs 13,000 times, and so on.

You have many options for how to represent such a file of information. Here, we consider the problem of designing a *binary character code* (or *code* for short)
