**Figure 16.1** The action of MULTIPOP on a stack S, shown initially in **(a)**. The top 4 objects are popped by MULTIPOP(S, 4), whose result is shown in **(b)**. The next operation is MULTIPOP(S, 7), which empties the stack—shown in **(c)**—since fewer than 7 objects remained.

Since each of these operations runs in O(1) time, let us consider the cost of each to be 1. The total cost of a sequence of n PUSH and POP operations is therefore n, and the actual running time for n operations is therefore Θ(n).

Now let's add the stack operation MULTIPOP(S, k), which removes the k top objects of stack S, popping the entire stack if the stack contains fewer than k objects. Of course, the procedure assumes that k is positive, and otherwise, the MULTIPOP operation leaves the stack unchanged. In the pseudocode for MULTIPOP, the operation STACK-EMPTY returns TRUE if there are no objects currently on the stack, and FALSE otherwise. Figure 16.1 shows an example of MULTIPOP.

```
MULTIPOP(S, k)
1 while not STACK-EMPTY(S) and k > 0
2 POP(S)
3 k = k - 1
```

What is the running time of MULTIPOP(S, k) on a stack of s objects? The actual running time is linear in the number of POP operations actually executed, and thus we can analyze MULTIPOP in terms of the abstract costs of 1 each for PUSH and POP. The number of iterations of the **while** loop is the number min{s, k} of objects popped off the stack. Each iteration of the loop makes one call to POP in line 2. Thus, the total cost of MULTIPOP is min{s, k}, and the actual running time is a linear function of this cost.

Now let's analyze a sequence of n PUSH, POP, and MULTIPOP operations on an initially empty stack. The worst-case cost of a MULTIPOP operation in the sequence is O(n), since the stack size is at most n. The worst-case time of any stack operation is therefore O(n), and hence a sequence of n operations costs O(n²), since the sequence contains at most n MULTIPOP operations costing O(n) each. 

Although this analysis is correct, the O(n²) result, which came from considering the worst-case cost of each operation individually, is not tight.

Yes, a single MULTIPOP might be expensive, but an aggregate analysis shows that any sequence of n PUSH, POP, and MULTIPOP operations on an initially empty stack has an upper bound on its cost of O(n). Why? An object cannot be popped from the stack unless it was first pushed. Therefore, the number of times that POP can be called on a nonempty stack, including calls within MULTIPOP, is at most the number of PUSH operations, which is at most n. For any value of n, any sequence of n PUSH, POP, and MULTIPOP operations takes a total of O(n) time. Averaging over the n operations gives an average cost per operation of O(n)/n = O(1). Aggregate analysis assigns the amortized cost of each operation to be the average cost. In this example, therefore, all three stack operations have an amortized cost of O(1).

To recap: although the average cost, and hence the running time, of a stack operation is O(1), the analysis did not rely on probabilistic reasoning. Instead, the analysis yielded a *worst-case* bound of O(n) on a sequence of n operations. Dividing this total cost by n yielded that the average cost per operation—that is, the amortized cost—is O(1).

#### **Incrementing a binary counter**

As another example of aggregate analysis, consider the problem of implementing a k-bit binary counter that counts upward from 0. An array A[0 : k-1] of bits represents the counter. A binary number x that is stored in the counter has its lowest-order bit in A[0] and its highest-order bit in A[k-1], so that x = Σ(i=0 to k-1) A[i]·2^i. Initially, x = 0, and thus A[i] = 0 for i = 0, 1, ..., k-1. To add 1 (modulo 2^k) to the value in the counter, call the INCREMENT procedure.

```
INCREMENT(A, k)
1 i = 0
2 while i < k and A[i] == 1
3 A[i] = 0
4 i = i + 1
5 if i < k
6 A[i] = 1
```

Figure 16.2 shows what happens to a binary counter when INCREMENT is called 16 times, starting with the initial value 0 and ending with the value 16. Each iteration of the **while** loop in lines 2-3-4 adds a 1 into position i. If A[i] = 1, then adding 1 flips the bit to 0 in position i and yields a carry of 1, to be added into

**Figure 16.2** An 8-bit binary counter as its value goes from 0 to 16 by a sequence of 16 INCREMENT operations. Bits that flip to achieve the next value are shaded in blue. The running cost for flipping bits is shown at the right. The total cost is always less than twice the total number of INCREMENT operations.

position i + 1 during the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the loop ends, and then, if i < k, A[i] must be 0, so that line 6 adds a 1 into position i, flipping the 0 to a 1. If the loop ends with i = k, then the call of INCREMENT flipped all k bits from 1 to 0. The cost of each INCREMENT operation is linear in the number of bits flipped.

As with the stack example, a cursory analysis yields a bound that is correct but not tight. A single execution of INCREMENT takes Θ(k) time in the worst case, in which all the bits in array A are 1. Thus, a sequence of n INCREMENT operations on an initially zero counter takes O(nk) time in the worst case.

Although a single call of INCREMENT might flip all k bits, not all bits flip upon each call. (Note the similarity to MULTIPOP, where a single call might pop many objects, but not every call pops many objects.) As Figure 16.2 shows, A[0] does flip each time INCREMENT is called. The next bit up, A[1], flips only every other time: a sequence of n INCREMENT operations on an initially zero counter causes A[1] to flip ⌊n/2⌋ times. Similarly, bit A[2] flips only every fourth time, or ⌊n/4⌋ times in a sequence of n INCREMENT operations. In general, for i = 0, 1, ..., k-1, bit A[i] flips ⌊n/2^i⌋ times in a sequence of n INCREMENT operations on an initially zero counter. For i ≥ k, bit A[i] does not exist, and so it cannot flip. The total number

of flips in the sequence is thus

$$\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2^i} \right\rfloor < n \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^i}$$

$$= 2n,$$

by equation (A.7) on page 1142. Thus, a sequence of n INCREMENT operations on an initially zero counter takes O(n) time in the worst case. The average cost of each operation, and therefore the amortized cost per operation, is O(n)/n = O(1).

#### **Exercises**

# *16.1-1*

If the set of stack operations includes a MULTIPUSH operation, which pushes k items onto the stack, does the O(1) bound on the amortized cost of stack operations continue to hold?

# *16.1-2*

Show that if a DECREMENT operation is included in the k-bit counter example, n operations can cost as much as Θ(nk) time.

#### *16.1-3*

Use aggregate analysis to determine the amortized cost per operation for a sequence of n operations on a data structure in which the ith operation costs i if i is an exact power of 2, and 1 otherwise.

# **16.2 The accounting method**

In the *accounting method* of amortized analysis, you assign differing charges to different operations, with some operations charged more or less than they actually cost. The amount that you charge an operation is its *amortized cost*. When an operation's amortized cost exceeds its actual cost, you assign the difference to specific objects in the data structure as *credit*. Credit can help pay for later operations whose amortized cost is less than their actual cost. Thus, you can view the amortized cost of an operation as being split between its actual cost and credit that is either deposited or used up. Different operations may have different amortized costs. This method differs from aggregate analysis, in which all operations have the same amortized cost.

You must choose the amortized costs of operations carefully. If you want to use amortized costs to show that in the worst case the average cost per operation is
