The tree on the left represents the set {b, c, e, h}, with c as the representative, and the tree on the right represents the set {d, f, g}, with f as the representative. **(b)** The result of UNION(e, g).

ple path toward the root constitute the *find path*. A UNION operation, shown in Figure 19.4(b), simply causes the root of one tree to point to the root of the other.

# **Heuristics to improve the running time**

So far, disjoint-set forests have not improved on the linked-list implementation. A sequence of n − 1 UNION operations could create a tree that is just a linear chain of n nodes. By using two heuristics, however, we can achieve a running time that is almost linear in the total number m of operations.

The first heuristic, *union by rank*, is similar to the weighted-union heuristic we used with the linked-list representation. The common-sense approach is to make the root of the tree with fewer nodes point to the root of the tree with more nodes. Rather than explicitly keeping track of the size of the subtree rooted at each node, however, we'll adopt an approach that eases the analysis. For each node, maintain a *rank*, which is an upper bound on the height of the node. Union by rank makes the root with smaller rank point to the root with larger rank during a UNION operation.

The second heuristic, *path compression*, is also quite simple and highly effective. As shown in Figure 19.5, FIND-SET operations use it to make each node on the find path point directly to the root. Path compression does not change any ranks.

#### **Pseudocode for disjoint-set forests**

The union-by-rank heuristic requires its implementation to keep track of ranks. With each node x, maintain the integer value x.*rank*, which is an upper bound on the height of x (the number of edges in the longest simple path from a descendant leaf to x). When MAKE-SET creates a singleton set, the single node in the

Triangles represent subtrees whose roots are the nodes shown. Each node has a pointer to its parent. **(b)** The same set after executing FIND-SET(a). Each node on the find path now points directly to the root.

corresponding tree has an initial rank of 0. Each FIND-SET operation leaves all ranks unchanged. The UNION operation has two cases, depending on whether the roots of the trees have equal rank. If the roots have unequal ranks, make the root with higher rank the parent of the root with lower rank, but don't change the ranks themselves. If the roots have equal ranks, arbitrarily choose one of the roots as the parent and increment its rank.

Let's put this method into pseudocode, appearing on the next page. The parent of node x is denoted by x:*p*. The LINK procedure, a subroutine called by UNION, takes pointers to two roots as inputs. The FIND-SET procedure with path compression, implemented recursively, turns out to be quite simple.

The FIND-SET procedure is a *two-pass method*: as it recurses, it makes one pass up the find path to find the root, and as the recursion unwinds, it makes a second pass back down the find path to update each node to point directly to the root. Each call of FIND-SET(x) returns x.*p* in line 3. If x is the root, then FIND-SET skips line 2 and just returns x.*p*, which is x. In this case the recursion bottoms out. Otherwise, line 2 executes, and the recursive call with parameter x.*p* returns

```
MAKE-SET(x)
1 x.p = x
2 x.rank = 0
UNION(x, y)
1 LINK(FIND-SET(x), FIND-SET(y))
LINK(x, y)
1 if x.rank > y.rank
2     y.p = x
3 else x.p = y
4     if x.rank == y.rank
5         y.rank = y.rank + 1
FIND-SET(x)
1 if x ≠ x.p    // not the root?
2     x.p = FIND-SET(x.p)    // the root becomes the parent
3 return x.p    // return the root
```

a pointer to the root. Line 2 updates node x to point directly to the root, and line 3 returns this pointer.

#### **Effect of the heuristics on the running time**

Separately, either union by rank or path compression improves the running time of the operations on disjoint-set forests, and combining the two heuristics yields an even greater improvement. Alone, union by rank yields a running time of O(m lg n) for a sequence of m operations, n of which are MAKE-SET (see Exercise 19.4-4), and this bound is tight (see Exercise 19.3-3). Although we won't prove it here, for a sequence of n MAKE-SET operations (and hence at most n − 1 UNION operations) and f FIND-SET operations, the worst-case running time using only the path-compression heuristic is Θ(n + f · (1 + log₂₊f/ₙ n)).

Combining union by rank and path compression gives a worst-case running time of O(m α(n)), where α(n) is a *very* slowly growing function, defined in Section 19.4. In any conceivable application of a disjoint-set data structure, α(n) ≤ 4, and thus, its running time is as good as linear in m for all practical purposes. Mathematically speaking, however, it is superlinear. Section 19.4 proves this O(m α(n)) upper bound.

Consider the operation PRINT-SET(x), which is given a node x and prints all the members of x's set, in any order. Show how to add just a single attribute to each node in a disjoint-set forest so that PRINT-SET(x) takes time linear in the number of members of x's set and the asymptotic running times of the other operations are unchanged. Assume that you can print each member of the set in O(1) time.

# ? *19.3-5*

Show that any sequence of m MAKE-SET, FIND-SET, and LINK operations, where all the LINK operations appear before any of the FIND-SET operations, takes only O(m) time when using both path compression and union by rank. You may assume that the arguments to LINK are roots within the disjoint-set forest. What happens in the same situation when using only path compression and not union by rank?

# ? **19.4 Analysis of union by rank with path compression**

As noted in Section 19.3, the combined union-by-rank and path-compression heuristic runs in O(m α(n)) time for m disjoint-set operations on n elements. In this section, we'll explore the function α to see just how slowly it grows. Then we'll analyze the running time using the potential method of amortized analysis.
