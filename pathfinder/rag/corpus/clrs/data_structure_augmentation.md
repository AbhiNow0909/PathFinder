for example, in determining additional information and developing new operations (steps 2 and 4) if you cannot maintain the additional information efficiently. Nevertheless, this four-step method provides a good focus for your efforts in augmenting a data structure, and it is also a good framework for documenting an augmented data structure.

We followed these four steps in Section 17.1 to design order-statistic trees. For step 1, we chose red-black trees as the underlying data structure. Red-black trees seemed like a good starting point because they efficiently support other dynamic-set operations on a total order, such as MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR.

In Step 2, we added the *size* attribute, so that each node x stores the size of the subtree rooted at x. Generally, the additional information makes operations more efficient. For example, it is possible to implement OS-SELECT and OS-RANK using just the keys stored in the tree, but then they would not run in O(lg n) time. Sometimes, the additional information is pointer information rather than data, as in Exercise 17.2-1.

For step 3, we ensured that insertion and deletion can maintain the *size* attributes while still running in O(lg n) time. Ideally, you would like to update only a few elements of the data structure in order to maintain the additional information. For example, if each node simply stores its rank in the tree, the OS-SELECT and OS-RANK procedures run quickly, but inserting a new minimum element might cause a change to this information in every node of the tree. Because we chose to store subtree sizes instead, inserting a new element causes information to change in only O(lg n) nodes.

In Step 4, we developed the operations OS-SELECT and OS-RANK. After all, the need for new operations is why anyone bothers to augment a data structure in the first place. Occasionally, rather than developing new operations, you can use the additional information to expedite existing ones, as in Exercise 17.2-1.

#### **Augmenting red-black trees**

When red-black trees underlie an augmented data structure, we can prove that insertion and deletion can always efficiently maintain certain kinds of additional information, thereby simplifying step 3. The proof of the following theorem is similar to the argument from Section 17.1 that we can maintain the *size* attribute for order-statistic trees.

#### *Theorem 17.1 (Augmenting a red-black tree)*

Let f be an attribute that augments a red-black tree T of n nodes, and suppose that the value of f for each node x depends only the information in nodes x, x.left, and x.right (possibly including x.left.f and x.right.f), and that the value of x.f can 

be computed from this information in O(1) time. Then, the insertion and deletion operations can maintain the values of f in all nodes of T without asymptotically affecting the O(lg n) running times of these operations.

*Proof* The main idea of the proof is that a change to an f attribute in a node x propagates only to ancestors of x in the tree. That is, changing x.f may require x.p.f to be updated, but nothing else; updating x.p.f may require x.p.p.f to be updated, but nothing else; and so on up the tree. After updating T.root.f, no other node depends on the new value, and so the process terminates. Since the height of a red-black tree is O(lg n), changing an f attribute in a node costs O(lg n) time in updating all nodes that depend on the change.

As we saw in Section 13.3, insertion of a node x into red-black tree T consists of two phases. If the tree T is empty, then the first phase simply makes x be the root of T. If T is not empty, then the first phase inserts x as a child of an existing node. Because we assume that the value of x.f depends only on information in the other attributes of x itself and the information in x's children, and because x's children are both the sentinel T.nil, it takes only O(1) time to compute the value of x.f. Having computed x.f, the change propagates up the tree. Thus, the total time for the first phase of insertion is O(lg n). During the second phase, the only structural changes to the tree come from rotations. Since only two nodes change in a rotation, but a change to an attribute might need to propagate up to the root, the total time for updating the f attributes is O(lg n) per rotation. Since the number of rotations during insertion is at most two, the total time for insertion is O(lg n).

Like insertion, deletion has two phases, as Section 13.4 discusses. In the first phase, changes to the tree occur when a node is deleted, and at most two other nodes could move within the tree. Propagating the updates to f caused by these changes costs at most O(lg n), since the changes modify the tree locally along a simple path from the lowest changed node to the root. Fixing up the red-black tree during the second phase requires at most three rotations, and each rotation requires at most O(lg n) time to propagate the updates to f. Thus, like insertion, the total time for deletion is O(lg n).

In many cases, such as maintaining the *size* attributes in order-statistic trees, the cost of updating after a rotation is O(1), rather than the O(lg n) derived in the proof of Theorem 17.1. Exercise 17.2-3 gives an example.

On the other hand, when an update after a rotation requires a traversal all the way up to the root, it is important that insertion into and deletion from a red-black tree require a constant number of rotations. The chapter notes for Chapter 13 list other schemes for balancing search trees that do not bound the number of rotations per insertion or deletion by a constant. If each operation might require Θ(lg n) rota

tions and each rotation traverses a path up to the root, then a single operation could require Θ(lg² n) time, rather than the O(lg n) time bound given by Theorem 17.1.

#### **Exercises**

## *17.2-1*

Show, by adding pointers to the nodes, how to support each of the dynamic-set queries MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR in O(1) worst-case time on an augmented order-statistic tree. The asymptotic performance of other operations on order-statistic trees should not be affected.

#### *17.2-2*

Can you maintain the black-heights of nodes in a red-black tree as attributes in the nodes of the tree without affecting the asymptotic performance of any of the red-black tree operations? Show how, or argue why not. How about maintaining the depths of nodes?

## *17.2-3*

Let ⊗ be an associative binary operator, and let a be an attribute maintained in each node of a red-black tree. Suppose that you want to include in each node x an additional attribute f such that x.f = x₁.a ⊗ x₂.a ⊗ ··· ⊗ xₘ.a, where x₁, x₂, ..., xₘ is the inorder listing of nodes in the subtree rooted at x. Show how to update the f attributes in O(1) time after a rotation. Modify your argument slightly to apply it to the *size* attributes in order-statistic trees.

# **17.3 Interval trees**

This section shows how to augment red-black trees to support operations on dynamic sets of intervals. In this section, we'll assume that intervals are closed. Extending the results to open and half-open intervals is conceptually straightforward. (See page 1157 for definitions of closed, open, and half-open intervals.)

Intervals are convenient for representing events that each occupy a continuous period of time. For example, you could query a database of time intervals to find out which events occurred during a given interval. The data structure in this section provides an efficient means for maintaining such an interval database.

A simple way to represent an interval [t₁, t₂] is as an object i with attributes i.low = t₁ (the *low endpoint*) and i.high = t₂ (the *high endpoint*). We say that intervals i and i' *overlap* if i ∩ i' ≠ ∅, that is, if i.low ≤ i'.high and i'.low ≤ i.high.
