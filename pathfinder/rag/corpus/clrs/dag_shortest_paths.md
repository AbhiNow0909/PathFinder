procedure makes just one pass over the vertices in the topologically sorted order. As it processes each vertex, it relaxes each edge that leaves the vertex. Figure 22.5 shows the execution of this algorithm.

```
DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS(G, w, s)
1 topologically sort the vertices of G
2 INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, s)
3 for each vertex u ∈ G.V, taken in topologically sorted order 
4   for each vertex v in G.Adj[u]
5     RELAX(u, v, w)
```

Let's analyze the running time of this algorithm. As shown in Section 20.4, the topological sort of line 1 takes Θ(V + E) time. The call of INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE in line 2 takes Θ(V) time. The **for** loop of lines 3-5 makes one iteration per vertex. Altogether, the **for** loop of lines 4-5 relaxes each edge exactly once. (We have used an aggregate analysis here.) Because each iteration of the inner **for** loop takes Θ(1) time, the total running time is Θ(V + E), which is linear in the size of an adjacency-list representation of the graph.

The following theorem shows that the DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS procedure correctly computes the shortest paths.

#### *Theorem 22.5*

If a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E) has source vertex s and no cycles, then at the termination of the DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS procedure, v.d = δ(s, v) for all vertices v ∈ V, and the predecessor subgraph Gπ is a shortest-paths tree.

*Proof* We first show that v.d = δ(s, v) for all vertices v ∈ V at termination. If v is not reachable from s, then v.d = δ(s, v) = ∞ by the no-path property. Now, suppose that v is reachable from s, so that there is a shortest path p = ⟨v₀, v₁, ..., vₖ⟩, where v₀ = s and vₖ = v. Because DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS processes the vertices in topologically sorted order, it relaxes the edges on p in the order (v₀, v₁), (v₁, v₂), ..., (vₖ₋₁, vₖ). The path-relaxation property implies that vᵢ.d = δ(s, vᵢ) at termination for i = 0, 1, ..., k. Finally, by the predecessor-subgraph property, Gπ is a shortest-paths tree.

A useful application of this algorithm arises in determining critical paths in *PERT chart*² analysis. A job consists of several tasks. Each task takes a certain

² "PERT" is an acronym for "program evaluation and review technique."

amount of time, and some tasks must be completed before others can be started. For example, if the job is to build a house, then the foundation must be completed before starting to frame the exterior walls, which must be completed before starting on the roof. Some tasks require more than one other task to be completed before they can be started: before the drywall can be installed over the wall framing, both the electrical system and plumbing must be installed. A dag models the tasks and dependencies. Edges represent tasks, with the weight of an edge indicating the time required to perform the task. Vertices represent "milestones," which are 

achieved when all the tasks represented by the edges entering the vertex have been completed. If edge (u, v) enters vertex v and edge (v, x) leaves v, then task (u, v) must be completed before task (v, x) is started. A path through this dag represents a sequence of tasks that must be performed in a particular order. A *critical path* is a *longest* path through the dag, corresponding to the longest time to perform any sequence of tasks. Thus, the weight of a critical path provides a lower bound on the total time to perform all the tasks, even if as many tasks as possible are performed simultaneously. You can find a critical path by either

- negating the edge weights and running DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS, or
- running DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS, but replacing "∞" by "-∞" in line 2 of INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE and ">" by "<" in the RELAX procedure.

#### **Exercises**

## *22.2-1*

Show the result of running DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS on the directed acyclic graph of Figure 22.5, using vertex r as the source.

#### *22.2-2*

Suppose that you change line 3 of DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS to read

³ **for** the first |V| - 1 vertices, taken in topologically sorted order

Show that the procedure remains correct.

#### *22.2-3*

An alternative way to represent a PERT chart looks more like the dag of Figure 20.7 on page 574. Vertices represent tasks and edges represent sequencing constraints, that is, edge (u, v) indicates that task u must be performed before task v. Vertices, not edges, have weights. Modify the DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS procedure so that it finds a longest path in a directed acyclic graph with weighted vertices in linear time.

## ★ *22.2-4*

Give an efficient algorithm to count the total number of paths in a directed acyclic graph. The count should include all paths between all pairs of vertices and all paths with 0 edges. Analyze your algorithm.

## **22.3 Dijkstra's algorithm**

Dijkstra's algorithm solves the single-source shortest-paths problem on a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E), but it requires nonnegative weights on all edges: w(u, v) ≥ 0 for each edge (u, v) ∈ E. As we shall see, with a good implementation, the running time of Dijkstra's algorithm is lower than that of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

You can think of Dijkstra's algorithm as generalizing breadth-first search to weighted graphs. A wave emanates from the source, and the first time that a wave arrives at a vertex, a new wave emanates from that vertex. Whereas breadth-first search operates as if each wave takes unit time to traverse an edge, in a weighted graph, the time for a wave to traverse an edge is given by the edge's weight. Because a shortest path in a weighted graph might not have the fewest edges, a simple, first-in, first-out queue won't suffice for choosing the next vertex from which to send out a wave.

Instead, Dijkstra's algorithm maintains a set S of vertices whose final shortest-path weights from the source s have already been determined. The algorithm repeatedly selects the vertex u ∈ V - S with the minimum shortest-path estimate, adds u into S, and relaxes all edges leaving u. The procedure DIJKSTRA replaces the first-in, first-out queue of breadth-first search by a min-priority queue Q of vertices, keyed by their d values.

```
DIJKSTRA(G, w, s)
1 INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, s)
2 S = ∅
3 Q = ∅
4 for each vertex u ∈ G.V 
5   INSERT(Q, u)
6 while Q ≠ ∅
7   u = EXTRACT-MIN(Q)
8   S = S ∪ {u}
9   for each vertex v in G.Adj[u]
10     RELAX(u, v, w)
11     if the call of RELAX decreased v.d 
12       DECREASE-KEY(Q, v, v.d)
```

Dijkstra's algorithm relaxes edges as shown in Figure 22.6. Line 1 initializes the d and π values in the usual way, and line 2 initializes the set S to the empty set. The algorithm maintains the invariant that Q = V - S at the start of each iteration
