A *priority queue* is a data structure for maintaining a set S of elements, each with an associated value called a *key*. A *max-priority queue* supports the following operations:

INSERT(S, x, k) inserts the element x with key k into the set S, which is equivalent to the operation S = S ∪ {x}.

MAXIMUM(S) returns the element of S with the largest key.

EXTRACT-MAX(S) removes and returns the element of S with the largest key.

INCREASE-KEY(S, x, k) increases the value of element x's key to the new value k, which is assumed to be at least as large as x's current key value.

Among their other applications, you can use max-priority queues to schedule jobs on a computer shared among multiple users. The max-priority queue keeps track of the jobs to be performed and their relative priorities. When a job is finished or interrupted, the scheduler selects the highest-priority job from among those pending by calling EXTRACT-MAX. The scheduler can add a new job to the queue at any time by calling INSERT.

Alternatively, a *min-priority queue* supports the operations INSERT, MINIMUM, EXTRACT-MIN, and DECREASE-KEY. A min-priority queue can be used in an event-driven simulator. The items in the queue are events to be simulated, each with an associated time of occurrence that serves as its key. The events must be simulated in order of their time of occurrence, because the simulation of an event can cause other events to be simulated in the future. The simulation program calls EXTRACT-MIN at each step to choose the next event to simulate. As new events are produced, the simulator inserts them into the min-priority queue by calling INSERT. We'll see other uses for min-priority queues, highlighting the DECREASE-KEY operation, in Chapters 21 and 22.

When you use a heap to implement a priority queue within a given application, elements of the priority queue correspond to objects in the application. Each object contains a key. If the priority queue is implemented by a heap, you need to determine which application object corresponds to a given heap element, and vice versa. Because the heap elements are stored in an array, you need a way to map application objects to and from array indices.

One way to map between application objects and heap elements uses *handles*, which are additional information stored in the objects and heap elements that give enough information to perform the mapping. Handles are often implemented to be opaque to the surrounding code, thereby maintaining an abstraction barrier between the application and the priority queue. For example, the handle within an application object might contain the corresponding index into the heap array. But since only the code for the priority queue accesses this index, the index is entirely hidden from the application code. Because heap elements change locations within

the array during heap operations, an actual implementation of the priority queue, upon relocating a heap element, must also update the array indices in the corresponding handles. Conversely, each element in the heap might contain a pointer to the corresponding application object, but the heap element knows this pointer as only an opaque handle and the application maps this handle to an application object. Typically, the worst-case overhead for maintaining handles is O(1) per access.

As an alternative to incorporating handles in application objects, you can store within the priority queue a mapping from application objects to array indices in the heap. The advantage of doing so is that the mapping is contained entirely within the priority queue, so that the application objects need no further embellishment. The disadvantage lies in the additional cost of establishing and maintaining the mapping. One option for the mapping is a hash table (see Chapter 11).<sup>1</sup> The added expected time for a hash table to map an object to an array index is just O(1), though the worst-case time can be as bad as Θ(n).

Let's see how to implement the operations of a max-priority queue using a maxheap. In the previous sections, we treated the array elements as the keys to be sorted, implicitly assuming that any satellite data moved with the corresponding keys. When a heap implements a priority queue, we instead treat each array element as a pointer to an object in the priority queue, so that the object is analogous to the satellite data when sorting. We further assume that each such object has an attribute *key*, which determines where in the heap the object belongs. For a heap implemented by an array A, we refer to A[i]:*key*.

The procedure MAX-HEAP-MAXIMUM on the facing page implements the MAXIMUM operation in Θ(1) time, and MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX implements the operation EXTRACT-MAX. MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX is similar to the **for** loop body (lines 3–5) of the HEAPSORT procedure. We implicitly assume that MAX-HEAPIFY compares priority-queue objects based on their *key* attributes. We also assume that when MAX-HEAPIFY exchanges elements in the array, it is exchanging pointers and also that it updates the mapping between objects and array indices. The running time of MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX is O(lg n), since it performs only a constant amount of work on top of the O(lg n) time for MAX-HEAPIFY, plus whatever overhead is incurred within MAX-HEAPIFY for mapping priority-queue objects to array indices.

The procedure MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY on page 176 implements the INCREASE-KEY operation. It first verifies that the new key k will not cause the key in the object x to decrease, and if there is no problem, it gives x the new key value. The procedure then finds the index i in the array corresponding to object x,

<sup>1</sup> In Python, dictionaries are implemented with hash tables.

```
MAX-HEAP-MAXIMUM(A)
1 if A:heap-size < 1
2     error "heap underflow"
3 return A[1]
MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX(A)
1 max = MAX-HEAP-MAXIMUM(A)
2 A[1] = A[A:heap-size]
3 A:heap-size = A:heap-size - 1
4 MAX-HEAPIFY(A, 1)
5 return max
```

so that A[i] is x. Because increasing the key of A[i] might violate the max-heap property, the procedure then, in a manner reminiscent of the insertion loop (lines 5–7) of INSERTION-SORT on page 19, traverses a simple path from this node toward the root to find a proper place for the newly increased key. As MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY traverses this path, it repeatedly compares an element's key to that of its parent, exchanging pointers and continuing if the element's key is larger, and terminating if the element's key is smaller, since the max-heap property now holds. (See Exercise 6.5-7 for a precise loop invariant.) Like MAX-HEAPIFY when used in a priority queue, MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY updates the information that maps objects to array indices when array elements are exchanged. Figure 6.5 shows an example of a MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY operation. In addition to the overhead for mapping priority queue objects to array indices, the running time of MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY on an n-element heap is O(lg n), since the path traced from the node updated in line 3 to the root has length O(lg n).

The procedure MAX-HEAP-INSERT on the next page implements the INSERT operation. It takes as inputs the array A implementing the max-heap, the new object x to be inserted into the max-heap, and the size n of array A. The procedure first verifies that the array has room for the new element. It then expands the max-heap by adding to the tree a new leaf whose key is -∞. Then it calls MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY to set the key of this new element to its correct value and maintain the max-heap property. The running time of MAX-HEAP-INSERT on an n-element heap is O(lg n) plus the overhead for mapping priority queue objects to indices.

In summary, a heap can support any priority-queue operation on a set of size n in O(lg n) time, plus the overhead for mapping priority queue objects to array indices.

```
MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A, x, k)
1 if k < x:key
2     error "new key is smaller than current key" 
3 x:key = k
4 find the index i in array A where object x occurs 
5 while i > 1 and A[PARENT(i)]:key < A[i]:key
6     exchange A[i] with A[PARENT(i)], updating the information that maps 
           priority queue objects to array indices 
7     i = PARENT(i)
MAX-HEAP-INSERT(A, x, n)
1 if A:heap-size == n
2     error "heap overflow"
3 A:heap-size = A:heap-size + 1
4 k = x:key
5 x:key = -∞
6 A[A:heap-size] = x
7 map x to index heap-size in the array 
8 MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A, x, k)
```

### **Exercises**

### *6.5-1*

Suppose that the objects in a max-priority queue are just keys. Illustrate the operation of MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX on the heap A = ⟨15, 13, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1⟩.

### *6.5-2*

Suppose that the objects in a max-priority queue are just keys. Illustrate the operation of MAX-HEAP-INSERT(A, 10) on the heap A = ⟨15, 13, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1⟩.

## *6.5-3*

Write pseudocode to implement a min-priority queue with a min-heap by writing the procedures MIN-HEAP-MINIMUM, MIN-HEAP-EXTRACT-MIN, MIN-HEAP-DECREASE-KEY, and MIN-HEAP-INSERT.

## *6.5-4*

**Figure 6.5** The operation of MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY. Only the key of each element in the priority queue is shown. The node indexed by i in each iteration is shown in blue. **(a)** The max-heap of Figure 6.4(a) with i indexing the node whose key is about to be increased. **(b)** This node has its key increased to 15. **(c)** After one iteration of the **while** loop of lines 5–7, the node and its parent have exchanged keys, and the index i moves up to the parent. **(d)** The max-heap after one more iteration of the **while** loop. At this point, A[PARENT(i)] ≥ A[i]. The max-heap property now holds and the procedure terminates.

## *6.5-5*

Why does MAX-HEAP-INSERT bother setting the key of the inserted object to -∞ in line 5 given that line 8 will set the object's key to the desired value?

### *6.5-6*

Professor Uriah suggests replacing the **while** loop of lines 5–7 in MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY by a call to MAX-HEAPIFY. Explain the flaw in the professor's idea.

### *6.5-7*

Argue the correctness of MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY using the following loop invariant:

At the start of each iteration of the **while** loop of lines 5–7:

- a. If both nodes PARENT(i) and LEFT(i) exist, then A[PARENT(i)]:*key* ≥ A[LEFT(i)]:*key*.
- b. If both nodes PARENT(i) and RIGHT(i) exist, then A[PARENT(i)]:*key* ≥ A[RIGHT(i)]:*key*.
- c. The subarray A[1:A:*heap*-*size*] satisfies the max-heap property, except that there may be one violation, which is that A[i]:*key* may be greater than A[PARENT(i)]:*key*.

You may assume that the subarray A[1:A:*heap*-*size*] satisfies the max-heap property at the time MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY is called.

## *6.5-8*

Each exchange operation on line 6 of MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY typically requires three assignments, not counting the updating of the mapping from objects to array indices. Show how to use the idea of the inner loop of INSERTION-SORT to reduce the three assignments to just one assignment.

## *6.5-9*

## *6.5-11*

Give an O(n lg k)-time algorithm to merge k sorted lists into one sorted list, where n is the total number of elements in all the input lists. (*Hint:* Use a minheap for k-way merging.)

## **Problems**

### *6-1 Building a heap using insertion*

One way to build a heap is by repeatedly calling MAX-HEAP-INSERT to insert the elements into the heap. Consider the procedure BUILD-MAX-HEAP′ on the facing page. It assumes that the objects being inserted are just the heap elements.

```
BUILD-MAX-HEAP′(A, n)
1 A:heap-size = 1
2 for i = 2 to n
3     MAX-HEAP-INSERT(A, A[i], n)
```

- *a.* Do the procedures BUILD-MAX-HEAP and BUILD-MAX-HEAP′ always create the same heap when run on the same input array? Prove that they do, or provide a counterexample.
- *b.* Show that in the worst case, BUILD-MAX-HEAP′ requires Θ(n lg n) time to build an n-element heap.

## *6-2 Analysis of* d*-ary heaps*

A d*-ary heap* is like a binary heap, but (with one possible exception) nonleaf nodes have d children instead of two children. In all parts of this problem, assume that the time to maintain the mapping between objects and heap elements is O(1) per operation.

- *a.* Describe how to represent a d-ary heap in an array.
- *b.* Using Θ-notation, express the height of a d-ary heap of n elements in terms of n and d.
- *c.* Give an efficient implementation of EXTRACT-MAX in a d-ary max-heap. Analyze its running time in terms of d and n.
- *d.* Give an efficient implementation of INCREASE-KEY in a d-ary max-heap. Analyze its running time in terms of d and n.
- *e.* Give an efficient implementation of INSERT in a d-ary max-heap. Analyze its running time in terms of d and n.

### *6-3 Young tableaus*

An m × n *Young tableau* is an m × n matrix such that the entries of each row are in sorted order from left to right and the entries of each column are in sorted order from top to bottom. Some of the entries of a Young tableau may be ∞, which we treat as nonexistent elements. Thus, a Young tableau can be used to hold r ≤ mn finite numbers.

*a.* Draw a 4×4 Young tableau containing the elements {9, 16, 3, 2, 4, 8, 5, 14, 12}.

- *b.* Argue that an m × n Young tableau Y is empty if Y[1, 1] = ∞. Argue that Y is full (contains mn elements) if Y[m, n] < ∞.
- *c.* Give an algorithm to implement EXTRACT-MIN on a nonempty m × n Young tableau that runs in O(m + n) time. Your algorithm should use a recursive subroutine that solves an m × n problem by recursively solving either an (m - 1) × n or an m × (n - 1) subproblem. (*Hint:* Think about MAX-HEAPIFY.) Explain why your implementation of EXTRACT-MIN runs in O(m + n) time.
- *d.* Show how to insert a new element into a nonfull m × n Young tableau in O(m + n) time.
- *e.* Using no other sorting method as a subroutine, show how to use an n×n Young tableau to sort n² numbers in O(n³) time.
- *f.* Give an O(m + n)-time algorithm to determine whether a given number is stored in a given m × n Young tableau.

## **Chapter notes**

The heapsort algorithm was invented by Williams [456], who also described how to implement a priority queue with a heap. The BUILD-MAX-HEAP procedure was suggested by Floyd [145]. Schaffer and Sedgewick [395] showed that in the best case, the number of times elements move in the heap during heapsort is approximately (n/2)lg n and that the average number of moves is approximately n lg n.

We use min-heaps to implement min-priority queues in Chapters 15, 21, and 22. Other, more complicated, data structures give better time bounds for certain minpriority queue operations. Fredman and Tarjan [156] developed Fibonacci heaps, which support INSERT and DECREASE-KEY in O(1) amortized time (see Chapter 16). That is, the average worst-case running time for these operations is O(1). Brodal, Lagogiannis, and Tarjan [73] subsequently devised strict Fibonacci heaps, which make these time bounds the actual running times. If the keys are unique and drawn from the set {0, 1, ..., n - 1} of nonnegative integers, van Emde Boas trees [440, 441] support the operations INSERT, DELETE, SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, PREDECESSOR, and SUCCESSOR in O(lg lg n) time.

If the data are b-bit integers, and the computer memory consists of addressable b-bit words, Fredman and Willard [157] showed how to implement MINIMUM in O(1) time and INSERT and EXTRACT-MIN in O(√lg n) time. Thorup [436] has

improved the O(√lg n) bound to O(lg lg n) time by using randomized hashing, requiring only linear space.

An important special case of priority queues occurs when the sequence of EXTRACT-MIN operations is *monotone*, that is, the values returned by successive EXTRACT-MIN operations are monotonically increasing over time. This case arises in several important applications, such as Dijkstra's single-source shortestpaths algorithm, which we discuss in Chapter 22, and in discrete-event simulation. For Dijkstra's algorithm it is particularly important that the DECREASE-KEY operation be implemented efficiently. For the monotone case, if the data are integers in the range 1, 2, ..., C, Ahuja, Mehlhorn, Orlin, and Tarjan [8] describe how to implement EXTRACT-MIN and INSERT in O(lg C) amortized time (Chapter 16 presents amortized analysis) and DECREASE-KEY in O(1) time, using a data structure called a radix heap. The O(lg C) bound can be improved to O(√lg C) using Fibonacci heaps in conjunction with radix heaps. Cherkassky, Goldberg, and Silverstein [90] further improved the bound to O(lg^(1/3)C) expected time by combining the multilevel bucketing structure of Denardo and Fox [112] with the heap of Thorup mentioned earlier. Raman [375] further improved these results to obtain a bound of O(min{lg^(1/4)C, lg^(1/3)n}), for any fixed ε > 0.

Many other variants of heaps have been proposed. Brodal [72] surveys some of these developments.

# **7 Quicksort**

The quicksort algorithm has a worst-case running time of Θ(n²) on an input array of n numbers. Despite this slow worst-case running time, quicksort is often the best practical choice for sorting because it is remarkably efficient on average: its expected running time is Θ(n lg n) when all numbers are distinct, and the constant factors hidden in the Θ(n lg n) notation are small. Unlike merge sort, it also has the advantage of sorting in place (see page 158), and it works well even in virtualmemory environments.

Our study of quicksort is broken into four sections. Section 7.1 describes the algorithm and an important subroutine used by quicksort for partitioning. Because the behavior of quicksort is complex, we'll start with an intuitive discussion of its performance in Section 7.2 and analyze it precisely at the end of the chapter. Section 7.3 presents a randomized version of quicksort. When all elements are distinct,<sup>1</sup> this randomized algorithm has a good expected running time and no particular input elicits its worst-case behavior. (See Problem 7-2 for the case in which elements may be equal.) Section 7.4 analyzes the randomized algorithm, showing that it runs in Θ(n²) time in the worst case and, assuming distinct elements, in expected O(n lg n) time.

<sup>1</sup> You can enforce the assumption that the values in an array A are distinct at the cost of Θ(n) additional space and only constant overhead in running time by converting each input value A[i] to an ordered pair (A[i], i) with (A[i], i) < (A[j], j) if A[i] < A[j] or if A[i] = A[j] and i < j. There are also more practical variants of quicksort that work well when elements are not distinct.
