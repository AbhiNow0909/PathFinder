- 4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
- 5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.

Figure 13.1(a) shows an example of a red-black tree.

As a matter of convenience in dealing with boundary conditions in red-black tree code, we use a single sentinel to represent NIL (see page 262). For a red-black tree T, the sentinel T:*nil* is an object with the same attributes as an ordinary node in the tree. Its *color* attribute is BLACK, and its other attributes—p, *left*, *right*, and *key*—can take on arbitrary values. As Figure 13.1(b) shows, all pointers to NIL are replaced by pointers to the sentinel T:*nil*.

Why use the sentinel? The sentinel makes it possible to treat a NIL child of a node x as an ordinary node whose parent is x. An alternative design would use a distinct sentinel node for each NIL in the tree, so that the parent of each NIL is well defined. That approach needlessly wastes space, however. Instead, just the one sentinel T:*nil* represents all the NILs—all leaves and the root's parent. The values of the attributes p, *left*, *right*, and *key* of the sentinel are immaterial. The red-black tree procedures can place whatever values in the sentinel that yield simpler code.

We generally confine our interest to the internal nodes of a red-black tree, since they hold the key values. The remainder of this chapter omits the leaves in drawings of red-black trees, as shown in Figure 13.1(c).

We call the number of black nodes on any simple path from, but not including, a node x down to a leaf the *black-height* of the node, denoted bh(x). By property 5, the notion of black-height is well defined, since all descending simple paths from the node have the same number of black nodes. The black-height of a red-black tree is the black-height of its root.

The following lemma shows why red-black trees make good search trees.

### *Lemma 13.1*

A red-black tree with n internal nodes has height at most 2 lg(n + 1).

*Proof* We start by showing that the subtree rooted at any node x contains at least 2^(bh(x)) - 1 internal nodes. We prove this claim by induction on the height of x. If the height of x is 0, then x must be a leaf (T:*nil*), and the subtree rooted at x indeed contains at least 2^(bh(x)) - 1 = 2⁰ - 1 = 0 internal nodes. For the inductive step, consider a node x that has positive height and is an internal node. Then node x has two children, either or both of which may be a leaf. If a child is black, then it contributes 1 to x's black-height but not to its own. If a child is red, then it contributes to neither x's black-height nor its own. Therefore, each child has a black-height of either bh(x) - 1 (if it's black) or bh(x) (if it's red). Since the height of a child of x is less than the height of x itself, we can apply the inductive

**Figure 13.1** A red-black tree. Every node in a red-black tree is either red or black, the children of a red node are both black, and every simple path from a node to a descendant leaf contains the same number of black nodes. **(a)** Every leaf, shown as a NIL, is black. Each non-NIL node is marked with its black-height, where NILs have black-height 0. **(b)** The same red-black tree but with each NIL replaced by the single sentinel T:*nil*, which is always black, and with black-heights omitted. The root's parent is also the sentinel. **(c)** The same red-black tree but with leaves and the root's parent omitted entirely. The remainder of this chapter uses this drawing style.

hypothesis to conclude that each child has at least 2^(bh(x)-1) - 1 internal nodes. Thus, the subtree rooted at x contains at least (2^(bh(x)-1) - 1) + (2^(bh(x)-1) - 1) + 1 = 2^(bh(x)) - 1 internal nodes, which proves the claim.

To complete the proof of the lemma, let h be the height of the tree. According to property 4, at least half the nodes on any simple path from the root to a leaf, not including the root, must be black. Consequently, the black-height of the root must be at least h/2, and thus,

$$n\geq 2^{h/2}-1.$$

Moving the 1 to the left-hand side and taking logarithms on both sides yields lg(n + 1) ≥ h/2, or h ≤ 2 lg(n + 1).

As an immediate consequence of this lemma, each of the dynamic-set operations SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR runs in O(lg n) time on a red-black tree, since each can run in O(h) time on a binary search tree of height h (as shown in Chapter 12) and any red-black tree on n nodes is a binary search tree with height O(lg n). (Of course, references to NIL in the algorithms of Chapter 12 have to be replaced by T:*nil*.) Although the procedures TREE-INSERT and TREE-DELETE from Chapter 12 run in O(lg n) time when given a red-black tree as input, you cannot just use them to implement the dynamic-set operations INSERT and DELETE. They do not necessarily maintain the red-black properties, so you might not end up with a legal red-black tree. The remainder of this chapter shows how to insert into and delete from a red-black tree in O(lg n) time.

#### **Exercises**

#### *13.1-1*

In the style of Figure 13.1(a), draw the complete binary search tree of height 3 on the keys {1, 2, ..., 15}. Add the NIL leaves and color the nodes in three different ways such that the black-heights of the resulting red-black trees are 2, 3, and 4.

#### *13.1-2*

Draw the red-black tree that results after TREE-INSERT is called on the tree in Figure 13.1 with key 36. If the inserted node is colored red, is the resulting tree a red-black tree? What if it is colored black?

#### *13.1-3*

Define a *relaxed red-black tree* as a binary search tree that satisfies red-black properties 1, 3, 4, and 5, but whose root may be either red or black. Consider a relaxed red-black tree T whose root is red. If the root of T is changed to black but no other changes occur, is the resulting tree a red-black tree?

### *13.1-4*

Suppose that every black node in a red-black tree "absorbs" all of its red children, so that the children of any red node become children of the black parent. (Ignore what happens to the keys.) What are the possible degrees of a black node after all its red children are absorbed? What can you say about the depths of the leaves of the resulting tree?

### *13.1-5*

Show that the longest simple path from a node x in a red-black tree to a descendant leaf has length at most twice that of the shortest simple path from node x to a descendant leaf.

### *13.1-6*

What is the largest possible number of internal nodes in a red-black tree with blackheight k? What is the smallest possible number?

### *13.1-7*

Describe a red-black tree on n keys that realizes the largest possible ratio of red internal nodes to black internal nodes. What is this ratio? What tree has the smallest possible ratio, and what is the ratio?

### *13.1-8*

Argue that in a red-black tree, a red node cannot have exactly one non-NIL child.

### **13.2 Rotations**

The search-tree operations TREE-INSERT and TREE-DELETE, when run on a redblack tree with n keys, take O(lg n) time. Because they modify the tree, the result may violate the red-black properties enumerated in Section 13.1. To restore these properties, colors and pointers within nodes need to change.

The pointer structure changes through *rotation*, which is a local operation in a search tree that preserves the binary-search-tree property. Figure 13.2 shows the two kinds of rotations: left rotations and right rotations. Let's look at a left rotation on a node x, which transforms the structure on the right side of the figure to the structure on the left. Node x has a right child y, which must not be T:*nil*. The left rotation changes the subtree originally rooted at x by "twisting" the link between x and y to the left. The new root of the subtree is node y, with x as y's left child and y's original left child (the subtree represented by β in the figure) as x's right child.

The pseudocode for LEFT-ROTATE appearing on the following page assumes that x:*right* ≠ T:*nil* and that the root's parent is T:*nil*. Figure 13.3 shows an
