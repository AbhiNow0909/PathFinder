## **10.1.2 Matrices**

We typically represent a matrix or two-dimensional array by one or more one-dimensional arrays. The two most common ways to store a matrix are row-major and column-major order. Let's consider an m × n matrix—a matrix with m rows and n columns. In *row-major order*, the matrix is stored row by row, and in *column-major order*, the matrix is stored column by column. For example, consider the 2 × 3 matrix

$$M = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{pmatrix}. \tag{10.1}$$

Row-major order stores the two rows 1 2 3 and 4 5 6, whereas column-major order stores the three columns 1 4; 2 5; and 3 6.

Parts (a) and (b) of Figure 10.1 show how to store this matrix using a single one-dimensional array. It's stored in row-major order in part (a) and in column-major order in part (b). If the rows, columns, and the single array all are indexed starting at s, then M[i, j]—the element in row i and column j—is at array index s + (n · (i - s)) + (j - s) with row-major order and s + (m · (j - s)) + (i - s) with column-major order. When s = 1, the single-array indices are n · (i - 1) + j with row-major order and i + m · (j - 1) with column-major order. When s = 0, the single-array indices are simpler: ni + j with row-major order and i + mj with column-major order. For the example matrix M with 1-origin indexing, element M[2, 1] is stored at index 3 · (2 - 1) + 1 = 4 in the single array using row-major order and at index 2 + 2 · (1 - 1) = 2 using column-major order.

Parts (c) and (d) of Figure 10.1 show multiple-array strategies for storing the example matrix. In part (c), each row is stored in its own array of length n, shown in tan. Another array, with m elements, shown in blue, points to the m row arrays. If we call the blue array A, then A[i] points to the array storing the entries for row i of M, and array element A[i][j] stores matrix element M[i, j]. Part (d) shows the column-major version of the multiple-array representation, with n arrays, each of 

length m, representing the n columns. Matrix element M[i, j] is stored in array element A[j][i].

Single-array representations are typically more efficient on modern machines than multiple-array representations. But multiple-array representations can sometimes be more flexible, for example, allowing for "ragged arrays," in which the rows in the row-major version may have different lengths, or symmetrically for the column-major version, where columns may have different lengths.

Occasionally, other schemes are used to store matrices. In the *block representation*, the matrix is divided into blocks, and each block is stored contiguously. For example, a 4 4 matrix that is divided into 2 2 blocks, such as

$$\left(\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
13 & 14 & 15 & 16
\end{array}\right)$$

might be stored in a single array in the order h1; 2; 5; 6; 3; 4; 7; 8; 9; 10; 13; 14; 11; 12; 15; 16i.

### **10.1.3 Stacks and queues**

Stacks and queues are dynamic sets in which the element removed from the set by the DELETE operation is prespecified. In a *stack*, the element deleted from the set is the one most recently inserted: the stack implements a *last-in, first-out*, or *LIFO*, policy. Similarly, in a *queue*, the element deleted is always the one that has been in the set for the longest time: the queue implements a *first-in, first-out*, or *FIFO*, policy. There are several efficient ways to implement stacks and queues on a computer. Here, you will see how to use an array with attributes to store them.

### **Stacks**

The INSERT operation on a stack is often called PUSH, and the DELETE operation, which does not take an element argument, is often called POP. These names are allusions to physical stacks, such as the spring-loaded stacks of plates used in cafeterias. The order in which plates are popped from the stack is the reverse of the order in which they were pushed onto the stack, since only the top plate is accessible.

Figure 10.2 shows how to implement a stack of at most n elements with an array S[1:n]. The stack has attributes S.top, indexing the most recently inserted element, and S.size, equaling the size n of the array. The stack consists of elements S[1:S.top], where S[1] is the element at the bottom of the stack and S[S.top] is the element at the top.

**Figure 10.2** An array implementation of a stack S. Stack elements appear only in the tan positions. **(a)** Stack S has 4 elements. The top element is 9. **(b)** Stack S after the calls PUSH(S, 17) and PUSH(S, 3). **(c)** Stack S after the call POP(S) has returned the element 3, which is the one most recently pushed. Although element 3 still appears in the array, it is no longer in the stack. The top is element 17.

When S.top = 0, the stack contains no elements and is *empty*. We can test whether the stack is empty with the query operation STACK-EMPTY. Upon an attempt to pop an empty stack, the stack *underflows*, which is normally an error. If S.top exceeds S.size, the stack *overflows*.

The procedures STACK-EMPTY, PUSH, and POP implement each of the stack operations with just a few lines of code. Figure 10.2 shows the effects of the modifying operations PUSH and POP. Each of the three stack operations takes O(1) time.

```
STACK-EMPTY(S)
1 if S.top == 0
2 return TRUE 
3 else return FALSE 
PUSH(S, x)
1 if S.top == S.size
2 error "overflow"
3 else S.top = S.top + 1
4 S[S.top] = x
POP(S)
1 if STACK-EMPTY(S)
2 error "underflow"
3 else S.top = S.top - 1
4 return S[S.top + 1]
```

**Figure 10.3** A queue implemented using an array Q[1:12]. Queue elements appear only in the tan positions. **(a)** The queue has 5 elements, in locations Q[7:11]. **(b)** The configuration of the queue after the calls ENQUEUE(Q, 17), ENQUEUE(Q, 3), and ENQUEUE(Q, 5). **(c)** The configuration of the queue after the call DEQUEUE(Q) returns the key value 15 formerly at the head of the queue. The new head has key 6.

### **Queues**

We call the INSERT operation on a queue ENQUEUE, and we call the DELETE operation DEQUEUE. Like the stack operation POP, DEQUEUE takes no element argument. The FIFO property of a queue causes it to operate like a line of customers waiting for service. The queue has a *head* and a *tail*. When an element is enqueued, it takes its place at the tail of the queue, just as a newly arriving customer takes a place at the end of the line. The element dequeued is always the one at the head of the queue, like the customer at the head of the line, who has waited the longest.

Figure 10.3 shows one way to implement a queue of at most n - 1 elements using an array Q[1:n], with the attribute Q.size equaling the size n of the array. The queue has an attribute Q.head that indexes, or points to, its head. The attribute Q.tail indexes the next location at which a newly arriving element will be inserted into the queue. The elements in the queue reside in locations Q.head, Q.head + 1, ..., Q.tail - 1, where we "wrap around" in the sense that location 1 immediately follows location n in a circular order. When Q.head = Q.tail, the queue is empty. Initially, we have Q.head = Q.tail = 1. An attempt to dequeue an element from an empty queue causes the queue to underflow. When Q.head = Q.tail + 1 or both Q.head = 1 and Q.tail = Q.size, the queue is full, and an attempt to enqueue an element causes the queue to overflow.

In the procedures ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE, we have omitted the error checking for underflow and overflow. (Exercise 10.1-5 asks you to supply these checks.) Figure 10.3 shows the effects of the ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE operations. Each operation takes O(1) time.

```
ENQUEUE(Q, x)
1 Q[Q.tail] = x
2 if Q.tail == Q.size
3 Q.tail = 1
4 else Q.tail = Q.tail + 1
DEQUEUE(Q)
1 x = Q[Q.head]
2 if Q.head == Q.size
3 Q.head = 1
4 else Q.head = Q.head + 1
5 return x
```

### **Exercises**

### *10.1-1*

Consider an m × n matrix in row-major order, where both m and n are powers of 2 and rows and columns are indexed from 0. We can represent a row index i in binary by the lg m bits ⟨i_{lg m-1}, i_{lg m-2}, ..., i_0⟩ and a column index j in binary by the lg n bits ⟨j_{lg n-1}, j_{lg n-2}, ..., j_0⟩. Suppose that this matrix is a 2 × 2 block matrix, where each block has m/2 rows and n/2 columns, and it is to be represented by a single array with 0-origin indexing. Show how to construct the binary representation of the (lg m + lg n)-bit index into the single array from the binary representations of i and j.

### *10.1-2*

Using Figure 10.2 as a model, illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence PUSH(S, 4), PUSH(S, 1), PUSH(S, 3), POP(S), PUSH(S, 8), and POP(S) on an initially empty stack S stored in array S[1:6].

## *10.1-3*

Explain how to implement two stacks in one array A[1:n] in such a way that neither stack overflows unless the total number of elements in both stacks together is n. The PUSH and POP operations should run in O(1) time.

## *10.1-4*

Using Figure 10.3 as a model, illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence ENQUEUE(Q, 4), ENQUEUE(Q, 1), ENQUEUE(Q, 3), DEQUEUE(Q), ENQUEUE(Q, 8), and DEQUEUE(Q) on an initially empty queue Q stored in array Q[1:6].

## *10.1-5*

Rewrite ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE to detect underflow and overflow of a queue.

### *10.1-6*

Whereas a stack allows insertion and deletion of elements at only one end, and a queue allows insertion at one end and deletion at the other end, a *deque* (double-ended queue, pronounced like "deck") allows insertion and deletion at both ends. Write four O(1)-time procedures to insert elements into and delete elements from both ends of a deque implemented by an array.
